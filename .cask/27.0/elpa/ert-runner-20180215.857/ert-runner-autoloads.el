Define NAME (a symbol) as a test.

BODY is evaluated as a `progn' when the test is run.  It should
signal a condition on failure or just return if the test passes.

`should', `should-not' and `should-error' are useful for
assertions in BODY.

Use `ert' to run tests interactively.

Tests that are expected to fail can be marked as such
using :expected-result.  See `ert-test-result-type-p' for a
description of valid values for RESULT-TYPE.

Run the tests specified by SELECTOR, printing results to the terminal.

SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests', except if
SELECTOR is nil, in which case all tests rather than none will be
run; this makes the command line \"emacs -batch -l my-tests.el -f
ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit\" useful.

Returns the stats object.

Like `ert-run-tests-batch', but exits Emacs when done.

The exit status will be 0 if all test results were as expected, 1
on unexpected results, or 2 if the framework detected an error
outside of the tests (e.g. invalid SELECTOR or bug in the code
that runs the tests).

Run the tests specified by SELECTOR and display the results in a buffer.

SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests'.
OUTPUT-BUFFER-NAME and MESSAGE-FN should normally be nil; they
are used for automated self-tests and specify which buffer to use
and how to display message.
